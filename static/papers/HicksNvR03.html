 Michael Hicks, Adithya Nagarajan, and Robbert van Renesse.
 In <em>Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Open Architectures
  (OPENARCH)</em>, pages 87--96, April 2003.</font><p>
In disaster and combat situations, mobile cameras and other sensors
transmit real-time data, used by many operators or analysis tools.
Unfortunately, in the face of limited, unreliable resources, and varying
demands, not all users may be able to get the fidelity they require.  This
paper describes <em>MediaNet</em>, a distributed stream processing system
designed with the above scenarios in mind.
Unlike past approaches, MediaNet's users can intuitively specify
how the system should adapt based on their
individual needs.
MediaNet uses both local and on-line global resource
scheduling to improve user performance and network utilization, and
adapts without requiring underlying support for
resource reservations.  Performance experiments show that our scheduling
algorithm is reasonably fast, and that user performance and network
utilization are both significantly improved.
