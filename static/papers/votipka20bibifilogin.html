    Secure software development is a challenging task requiring consideration of many possible threats and mitigations. We reviewed code submitted by 94 teams in a secure-programming contest designed to mimic real-world constraintsâ€”correctness, performance, and security. We found that the competitors, many of whom were experienced programmers and had just completed a 24-week cybersecurity course sequence with specific instruction on secure coding and cryptography, still introduced several vulnerabilities (182 across all teams), mostly due to misunderstandings of security concepts. We explain our methodology, discuss trends in the types of vulnerabilities introduced, and offer suggestions for avoiding the kinds of problems we encountered.<p>[&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/winter2020/votipka">http</a>&nbsp;]
