 James Rose, Nikhil Swamy, and Michael Hicks.
 In <em>Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Principles of
  Distributed Computing (PODC) Workshop on Concurrency and Synchronization in
  Java Programs (CSJP)</em>, pages 18--25, July 2004.</font><p>
We present an approach for automatically proving the absence of race
conditions in multi-threaded Java programs, using a combination of
dynamic and static analysis.  The program in question is instrumented
so that when executed it will gather information about locking
relationships.  This information is then fed to our tool, FindLocks,
that generates annotations needed to type check the program using the
Race-Free Java type system.  Our approach
extends existing inference algorithms by being fully
context-sensitive.  We describe the design and implementation of our
approach, and our experience applying the tool to a variety of Java
programs.  In general, we have found the approach works well, but has
trouble scaling to large programs, which require extensive testing for
full coverage.
