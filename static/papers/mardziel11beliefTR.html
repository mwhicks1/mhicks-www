  This paper explores the idea of <em>knowledge-based security
    policies</em>, which are used to decide whether to answer queries over
  secret data based on an estimation of the querier's (possibly
  increased) knowledge given the results.  Limiting knowledge is the
  goal of existing information release policies that employ mechanisms
  such as noising, anonymization, and redaction.  Knowledge-based
  policies are more general: they increase flexibility by not fixing
  the means to restrict information flow.  We enforce a
  knowledge-based policy by explicitly tracking a model of a querier's
  belief about secret data, represented as a probability distribution,
  and denying any query that could increase knowledge above a given
  threshold.  We implement query analysis and belief tracking via
  abstract interpretation using a novel 
  <em>probabilistic polyhedral</em> domain, whose design permits trading off
  precision with performance while ensuring estimates of a querier's
  knowledge are sound.  Experiments with our implementation show that
  several useful queries can be handled efficiently, and performance
  scales far better than would more standard implementations of
  probabilistic computation based on sampling.
