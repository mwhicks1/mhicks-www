 Pavlos Papageorgiou and Michael Hicks.
 In <em>Proceedings of the IEEE Passive/Active Measurement Workshop
  (PAM)</em>, volume 3431, pages 368--371. Springer-Verlag, March 2005.</font><p>
The tasks of measurement and data transport are often treated
independently, but we believe there are benefits to bringing them
together.  This paper proposes the simple idea of a transport agent
to encapsulate useful data within probe packets in place of
useless padding.
