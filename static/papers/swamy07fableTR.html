This paper presents Fable, a core formalism for a programming language
in which programmers may specify security policies and reason that
these policies are properly enforced. In Fable,
security policies can be expressed by associating <em>security
labels</em> with the data or actions they protect. Programmers define the
semantics of labels in a separate part of the program called the
<em>enforcement policy</em>. Fable prevents a policy from being circumvented
by allowing labeled terms to be manipulated only within the enforcement
policy; application code must treat labeled values abstractly.
Together, these features
facilitate straightforward proofs that programs implementing a
particular policy achieve their high-level security goals.  Fable is
flexible enough to implement a wide variety of security policies,
including access control, information flow, provenance, and security
automata. We have implemented Fable as part of the Links web
programming language; we call the resulting language SELinks.  We
report on our experience using SElinks to build two substantial
applications, a wiki and an on-line store, equipped with a combination of
access control and provenance policies.
 To our knowledge, no existing framework enables
the enforcement of such a wide variety of security policies with an
equally high level of assurance.
