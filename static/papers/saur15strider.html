  Researchers have proposed many tools and techniques that work by
  traversing the heap, including checkpointing systems, heap
  profilers, heap assertion checkers, and dynamic software updating
  systems. Yet building a heap traversal for C remains difficult, and
  to our knowledge extant services have used their own application-specific
  traversals.  This paper presents C-strider, a framework for
  writing C heap traversals and transformations.  Writing a basic C-strider
  service requires implementing only four callbacks; C-strider then
  generates a program-specific traversal that invokes the callbacks as
  each heap location is visited.  Critically, C-strider is <em>type aware</em>---it
  tracks types as it walks the heap, so every callback is supplied
  with the exact type of the associated location. We used C-strider to
  implement heap serialization, dynamic software
  updating, heap checking, and profiling,
  and then applied the resulting traversals to several
  programs.  We found C-strider requires little programmer
  effort, and the resulting services are efficient and effective.
