  Many useful programming constructions can be expressed as monads.
  Examples include probabilistic modeling,
  functional reactive programming, parsing, and information flow tracking,
  not to mention effectful functionality like state and I/O.  In this
  paper, we present a type-based rewriting algorithm to make
  programming with arbitrary monads as easy as using ML&#39;s built-in
  support for state and I/O.  Developers write programs using monadic
  values of type <em>M</em> <em>t</em> as if they were of type <em>t</em>, and our algorithm
  inserts the necessary binds, units, and monad-to-monad morphisms so
  that the program type checks.  Our algorithm, based on Jones&#39;
  qualified types, produces principal types.  But principal
  types are sometimes 
  problematic: the program&#39;s semantics could depend on the choice of
  instantiation when more than one instantiation is valid.  In such 
  situations we are able to simplify the types to remove
  any ambiguity but without adversely affecting typability; thus we can
  accept strictly more programs.  Moreover, we have proved that this
  simplification is <em>efficient</em> (linear in the number of constraints)
  and <em>coherent</em>: while our algorithm induces a particular rewriting,
  all related rewritings will have the same semantics.
  We have implemented our approach for a core functional
  language and applied it successfully to simple examples from the
  domains listed above, which are used as illustrations throughout the
  paper.
