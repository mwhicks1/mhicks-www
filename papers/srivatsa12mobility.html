 Mudhakar Srivatsa and Michael Hicks.
 In <em>Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and
  Communications Security (CCS)</em>, October 2012.</font><p>
  Location-based services, which employ data from
  smartphones, vehicles, etc., are growing in popularity.  
  To reduce the threat that shared location data poses to a user&#39;s
  privacy, some services anonymize or obfuscate this data.
  In this paper, we show these methods can be effectively defeated: a
  set of location traces can be deanonymized given an easily
  obtained social network graph.
  The key idea of our approach is that a user may be identified by those she
  meets: a <em>contact graph</em> identifying meetings between
  anonymized users in a set of traces can be structurally correlated
  with a social network graph, thereby identifying anonymized
  users. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using three
  real world datasets: University of St Andrews mobility trace and
  social network (27 nodes each), SmallBlue contact trace and Facebook
  social network (125 nodes), and Infocom 2006 bluetooth contact
  traces and conference attendees&#39; DBLP social network (78 nodes). Our
  experiments show that 80% of users are identified
  precisely, while only 8% are identified incorrectly, with the
  remainder mapped to a small set of users.
