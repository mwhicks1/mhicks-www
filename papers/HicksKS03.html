Active Networks, being programmable,
promise greater flexibility than current networks.
Programmability, however, may
introduce safety and security risks.
This paper describes the design and implementation of a security
architecture for the active network PLANet.
Security is obtained with a two-level architecture that combines a
functionally restricted packet language, PLAN, with
an environment of general-purpose service routines governed by trust
management.  In particular, a technique is used 
which expands or contracts a packet&#39;s service environment based on its
level of privilege, termed <em>namespace-based security</em>.
The design and implementation of an active-network firewall and virtual
private network is used as an application of the security architecture.
Measurements of the system show that the addition of the firewall imposes an
approximately 34% latency overhead and as little as a 6.7% space overhead
to incoming packets.
