  Design and Implementation (PLDI)</em>, pages 13--24, June 2009.</font><p>
  Many dynamic updating systems have been developed that enable a
  program to be patched while it runs, to fix bugs or add new
  features.  This paper explores techniques for supporting dynamic
  updates to multi-threaded programs, focusing on the problem of
  applying an update in a timely fashion
  while still producing correct behavior.  Past work has shown that
  this tension of <em>safety</em> versus <em>timeliness</em> can be balanced for
  single-threaded programs.  For
  multi-threaded programs, the task is more difficult because
  myriad thread interactions complicate understanding the possible
  program states to which a patch could be applied.  Our approach allows
  the programmer to specify a few program points (e.g., one per
  thread) at which a patch may be applied, which simplifies reasoning
  about safety.  To improve timeliness, a combination of static
  analysis and run-time support automatically expands these few points
  to many more that produce behavior equivalent to
  the originals.  Experiments with thirteen realistic updates to three
  multi-threaded servers show that we can safely perform a dynamic
  update within milliseconds when more straightforward alternatives would
  delay some updates indefinitely.
