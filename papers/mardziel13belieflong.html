<font size="+1"><b>Dynamic Enforcement of Knowledge-based Security Policies using
  Probabilistic Abstract Interpretation</b>.
 Piotr Mardziel, Stephen Magill, Michael Hicks, and Mudhakar Srivatsa.
 <em>Journal of Computer Security</em>, 21:463--532, October 2013.</font><p>
  This paper explores the idea of <em>knowledge-based security
    policies</em>, which are used to decide whether to answer queries over
    secret data based on an estimation of the querier&#39;s (possibly
    increased) knowledge given the results.  Limiting knowledge is the
    goal of existing information release policies that employ
    mechanisms such as noising, anonymization, and redaction.
    Knowledge-based policies are more general: they increase
    flexibility by not fixing the means to restrict information flow.
    We enforce a knowledge-based policy by explicitly tracking a model
    of a querier&#39;s belief about secret data, represented as a
    probability distribution, and denying any query that could
    increase knowledge above a given threshold.  We implement query
    analysis and belief tracking via abstract interpretation, which allows us to
    trade off precision and performance through the use of
    abstraction. We have developed an approach to augment standard
    abstract domains to include probabilities, and thus define
    distributions.  We focus on developing <em>probabilistic
      polyhedra</em> in particular, to support numeric programs. While
    probabilistic abstract interpretation has been 
    considered before, our domain is the first whose design supports
    sound conditioning, which is required to ensure that estimates of
    a querier&#39;s knowledge are accurate. Experiments with our
    implementation show that several useful queries can be handled
    efficiently, particularly compared to exact (i.e., sound)
    inference involving sampling.  We also show that, for our
    benchmarks, restricting constraints to <em>octagons</em>
    or <em>intervals</em>, rather than full polyhedra, can dramatically
    improve performance while incurring little to no loss in
    precision.
