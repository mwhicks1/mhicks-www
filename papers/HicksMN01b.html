PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks) is a highly flexible
and usable active packet language, whereas SNAP (Safe and Nimble
Active Packets)  offers significant resource usage safety and
achieves much higher performance compared to PLAN, but at the cost
of flexibility and usability.  Ideally, we would like to combine
the good properties of PLAN with those of SNAP. We have achieved
this end by developing a compiler that translates PLAN
into SNAP. The compiler allows us to achieve the
flexibility and usability of PLAN, but with the safety and
efficiency of SNAP. In this paper, we describe both languages,
highlighting the features that require special compilation
techniques. We then present the details of our compiler and
experimental results to evaluate our compiler with respect to code
size.
