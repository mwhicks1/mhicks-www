  Many organizations specify <em>information release</em> policies to
  describe the terms under which sensitive information may be released
  to other organizations.  This paper presents a new approach for
  ensuring that security-critical software correctly enforces its
  information release policy.  Our approach has two parts.  First, an
  information release policy is specified as a security automaton
  written in a new language called AIR.  Second, we enforce an AIR
  policy by translating it into an API for programs written in Lair,
  a core formalism for a functional programming language. Lair uses
  a novel combination of dependent, affine, and singleton types to
  ensure that the API is used correctly. As a consequence we can
  certify that programs written in Lair meet the requirements of
  the original AIR policy specification.
