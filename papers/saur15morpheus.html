  2016.</font><p>
    SDN controllers must be periodically upgraded to add features,
  improve performance, and fix bugs, but current techniques for
  implementing <em>dynamic updates</em>---i.e., without disrupting
  ongoing network functions---are inadequate. Simply halting the old
  controller and bringing up the new one can cause state to be lost,
  leading to incorrect behavior. For example, if the state represents
  flows blacklisted by a firewall, then traffic that should be blocked
  may be allowed to pass through. Techniques based on record and
  replay can reconstruct controller state automatically, but they are
  expensive to deploy and do not work in all scenarios.</p><p>
  This paper presents a new approach to implementing dynamic updates
  for SDN controllers. We present the design and implementation of a
  new controller platform called Morpheus that uses <em>explicit state
  transfer</em> to implement dynamic updates. Morpheus enables programmers to
  directly initialize the upgraded controller&#39;s state as a function of
  its existing state, using a domain-specific language that is
  designed to be easy to use. Morpheus also offers a distributed protocol
  for safely deploying updates across multiple nodes. Experiments
  confirm that Morpheus provides correct behavior and good performance.
