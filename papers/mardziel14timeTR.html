  A metric is proposed for quantifying leakage of information about
  secrets and about how secrets change over time.
  The metric is used with a model of information flow for
  probabilistic, interactive systems with adaptive adversaries.
  The model and metric are implemented in a probabilistic programming
  language and used to analyze several examples. 
  The analysis demonstrates that adaptivity increases the amount of
  information that adversaries learn.
