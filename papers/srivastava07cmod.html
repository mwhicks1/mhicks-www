 Saurabh Srivastava, Michael Hicks, and Jeffrey S. Foster.
 In <em>Proceedings of the ACM Workshop on Types in Language Design
  and Implementation (TLDI)</em>, pages 3--14, January 2007.</font><p>
  This paper presents CMod, a novel tool that provides a sound
  module system for C .  CMod works by enforcing a set of four rules
  that are based on principles of modular reasoning and on current
  programming practice.  CMod&#39;s rules flesh out the convention that
  <tt>.h</tt> header files are module interfaces and <tt>.c</tt>
  source files are module implementations.  Although this convention
  is well-known, developing CMod&#39;s rules revealed there are many
  subtleties in applying the basic pattern correctly.  We have proven
  formally that CMod&#39;s rules enforce both information hiding and
  type-safe linking.
  We evaluated CMod on a number of benchmarks, and found
  that most programs obey CMod&#39;s rules, or can be made to with
  minimal effort, while rule violations reveal brittle coding practices
  including numerous information hiding violations and occasional type errors.
