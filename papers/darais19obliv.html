  An oblivious computation is one that is free of direct and indirect
  information leaks, e.g., due to observable differences in timing and
  memory access patterns.  This paper presents
  λ<sub>obliv</sub>, a core language whose type system enforces obliviousness.
  Prior work on type-enforced oblivious computation has focused on
  deterministic programs. λ<sub>obliv</sub> is new in its consideration of
  programs that implement <em>probabilistic</em> algorithms, such as
  those involved in cryptography. λ<sub>obliv</sub> employs a substructural type
  system and a novel notion of <em>probability region</em> to ensure that
  information is not leaked via the distribution of visible
  events. The use of regions was motivated by a source of unsoundness
  that we discovered in the type system of ObliVM, a language for implementing
  state of the art oblivious algorithms and data structures. We prove
  that λ<sub>obliv</sub>&#39;s type system enforces obliviousness and show that it is
  expressive enough to typecheck advanced tree-based oblivious RAMs.
