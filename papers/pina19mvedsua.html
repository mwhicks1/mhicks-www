  Execution</b>.

  Dynamic Software Updating (DSU) is a general-purpose technique for
patching stateful software without shutting it down, which enables
both timely updates and non-stop service. However, applying an update
could induce a long delay in service, and bugs in the
update---both in the changed code and in the specification for
effecting that change dynamically---may cause the updated software to
crash or misbehave. </p><p>
This paper proposes MVEDSUa, a system that solves these problems by
augmenting a DSU system with support for Multi-Version Execution
(MVE). To start, MVEDSUa performs an update in
parallel with the original system, thereby avoiding any service
delay. Then, it monitors that the updated and original systems&#39; responses agree
when given the same inputs. Expected differences are 
specified by the programmer, so remaining differences signal likely
errors. If the new version shows no problems, it can be installed
permanently.</p><p>
We implemented MVEDSUa on top of Kitsune and Varan, state-of-the-art DSU
and MVE systems respectively, and used it to update several
high-performance servers: redis, memcached, and vsftpd. Our
results show that MVEDSUa significantly reduces the update-time delay, imposes
little overhead in steady state, and easily recovers from a variety of
update-related errors.
