  Quantum computation is a topic of significant recent interest, with
practical advances coming from both research and
industry. A major challenge in 
quantum programming is dealing with errors (quantum noise) during
execution. Because quantum resources (e.g., qubits) are scarce,
classical error correction techniques applied at the level of the
architecture are currently cost-prohibitive. But while this reality means
that quantum programs are almost certain to have errors, there as yet
exists no principled means to reason about erroneous behavior.
This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a semantics for
erroneous quantum while-programs, as well as a logic for reasoning
about them. This logic permits proving a property we have
identified, called ε-robustness, which characterizes
possible “distance” between an ideal program and an erroneous one. We
have proved the logic sound, and showed its utility on several case
studies, notably: (1) analyzing the robustness of noisy versions of the
quantum Bernoulli factory (QBF) and quantum walk (QW); (2) demonstrating
the (in)effectiveness of different error correction schemes on
single-qubit errors; and (3) analyzing the robustness of a
fault-tolerant version of QBF.
