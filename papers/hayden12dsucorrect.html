  Dynamic software updating
  (DSU) systems allow running programs to be patched on-the-fly
  to add features or fix bugs.  While dynamic updates can be tricky
  to write, techniques for establishing their
  correctness have received little attention.
  In this paper, we present the first methodology for automatically
  verifying the correctness of dynamic updates.  Programmers express
  the desired properties of an updated execution using
  <em>client-oriented specifications</em> (CO-specs), which can describe a
  wide range of client-visible behaviors.
  We verify CO-specs automatically by using off-the-shelf tools to 
  analyze a <em>merged</em> program, which is a combination of the old and new
  versions of a program, along with the CO-spec.
  We formalize the merging transformation and prove it correct.  We
  also implemented a C program merger, and applied it to updates
  for the Redis key-value server and to updates for several synthetic
  programs.  Using the Thor verification tool we could verify
  many of the synthetic programs, while Otter, a symbolic
  executor, could analyze every program, often in less than a minute.
  Both tools were able to detect faulty patches and incurred only a
  factor-of-four slowdown, on average, compared with analyzing individual
  versions.
