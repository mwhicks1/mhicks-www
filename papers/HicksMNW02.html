Active Networking adds programmability to the elements
of the network, most aggressively by using programmable packets,
or <em>capsules</em>. ANTS and
PLANet are the most mature examples of
capsule-based systems, both having been publicly available for
several years. This paper presents our experience with these
systems and the lessons they hold for the future of capsule-based
Active Networking.</p><p>
The paper focuses on four key issues: flexibility, performance,
security, and usability.  We consider how ANTS and PLANet address
these issues, noting that despite substantial surface differences,
both systems identify similar key problems and use closely related
solutions.  Based on our experience with these systems we conclude
that capsule-based systems can achieve useful levels of
flexibility, performance, and usability.  Many aspects of security
can also be adequately addressed, but some important problems
related to denial of service remain as open problems.
