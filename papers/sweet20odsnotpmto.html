  Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS)</em>, November 2020.</font><p>
  Memory-trace Obliviousness (MTO) is a noninterference property: programs that enjoy it have neither explicit nor implicit information leaks, even when the adversary can observe the program counter and the address trace of memory accesses. <em>Probabilistic</em> MTO relaxes MTO to accept probabilistic programs. In prior work, we developed λ<sub>obliv</sub>, whose type system aims to enforce PMTO. We showed that λ<sub>obliv</sub> could typecheck (recursive) Tree ORAM, a sophisticated algorithm that implements a probabilistically oblivious key-value store. We conjectured that λ<sub>obliv</sub> ought to be able to typecheck more optimized <em>oblivious data structures</em> (ODSs), but that its type system was as yet too weak.</p><p>
In this short paper we show we were wrong: <em>ODSs cannot be implemented in λ<sub>obliv</sub> because they are not actually PMTO</em>, due to the possibility of <em>overflow</em>, meaning: a <tt>write</tt> may silently fail due to a local lack of space. This was surprising to us because Tree ORAM can also overflow but is still PMTO . The paper explains what is going on and sketches the task of adapting the PMTO property, and λ<sub>obliv</sub>&#39;s type system, to characterize ODS security.
