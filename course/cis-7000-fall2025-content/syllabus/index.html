These will be used to drive discussion of the paper during class – we cannot discuss what we do not read! Each review should consist of two parts: (1) a paragraph with key takeaways gleaned from the paper; (2) a few questions on topics that merit deep-dive discussion, or clarification. Note that part (1) should almost certainly not be complete (i.e., not an at-a-distance summary) but rather should be used to set up sufficient context and justification for the questions in part (2). Doing so ensures the questions are not surface-level, but rather are thought-through and engaging. You are writing a review, which means I want to see your opinion and your evidence for it. <strong>Reviews are due 3pm the day before the class</strong>, to avoid a late penalty of 20%. Reviews are <strong>graded on a score of 1-5</strong>, where</p><ul><li>0: missing or showing no evidence of having read the paper</li><li>1-3: minimal effort or non-insightful summary (anybody can copy an abstract)</li><li>4: insightful, but not particularly crisp or incisive; oftentimes too long</li><li>5: actively insightful, with interesting and well-sourced discussion points (it often takes students a couple stabs at it to get to consistent 5’s)</li></ul><h3 id="participating-and-presenting-in-class">Participating and presenting in class

The participation score will be based in large part on attendance (which we will start noting during the second week), but also on the instructor’s assessment of the thoughtfulness and insight of comments made during class.</p><p>Each student will be expected to <strong>present a paper and lead a discussion about it.</strong> The presentation should be about 25-30 minutes, with the ensuring discussion about 15 minutes. The goal is to learn to deep-dive into a relevant topic, and develop good presentation skills. Doing well will require reading your paper(s) early and to be sure you fully understand them. Consider practicing your presentation beforehand.</p><p>Presentations will be judged based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><strong>understanding</strong>: does the presenter understand the material?</li><li><strong>thoughtfulness</strong>: does the presenter have insights and opinions beyond what was in the paper?</li><li><strong>background/perspective</strong>: did the presenter read background papers?</li><li><strong>clarity</strong>: can the audience understand the presentation? is the “big picture” clear? are there useful examples?</li><li><strong>materials</strong>: do the slides or use of blackboard illustrate and support the talk? are there diagrams to help convey the technicalities? (when your talk gets into deep territory, a diagram is worth 10K words)</li><li><strong>delivery</strong>: has the the presenter practiced?</li><li><strong>non-regurgitation</strong>: did the presenter do something beyond simply typing sections of the paper as bullet points? did the presenter motivate the ideas in their own words or just state ideas from the paper verbatim?</li><li><strong>answering questions</strong>: can the presenter handle questions from the audience?</li></ul><p>Remember that you will likely be able to explain more detail than you can hope to cover in a single lecture. This is one reason that it’s hard work to prepare a good presentation: not only do you need to understand the paper, but you need to filter out the irrelevant details and amplify the key arguments. You’ll probably have omit entire sections of the paper from your talk – don’t worry about it. Simply mimicking the structure of the paper (“regurgitating it”) tends to produce a disconnected sequence of boring facts. A good talk should tell a story; every idea should be motivated, and all facts should fit together in a coherent picture. Telling such a story in a short time often requires creating your own explanations, motivation, and examples.</p><h3 id="projects">Projects

Students may work alone, or in groups of 2 or 3 (with a greater expectation on the result).</p><h4 id="project-ideas">Project ideas
<a href="#project-ideas"></a></h4><p>Here are a few ideas for project types:</p><ul><li>(1 person project) Deep <em>literature-based exploration of a particular area</em>, e.g., a cogent summarization of 10 or more technical papers, possibly augmented with experience using tools, etc.<ul><li>Related: A <em>proposal for new research</em>. Basically, summarize a bunch of prior work, and the gaps it exposes, and sketch the work you would like to see done that could fill those gaps.</li></ul></li><li><em>Reproduction, or extension, of a study</em> we have read about (or one in another paper we haven’t read). (2-4 people depending on scope)</li><li><em>Empirical study of some phenomenon</em>, e.g., a survey of humans or an examination (and/or construction of a data set) + data analysis (2-3 people depending on scope)</li><li><em>Risk management-style model</em> for a particular phenomenon, informed by realistic datasets (1-2 people depending on scope)</li></ul><p>One thing to think about is publishing the results in a peer-reviewed venue. For that to be possible, it might be that you aim to do part of the work for this class, and then finish it next semester. So you need to scope the two parts. If you are working with humans, we might need to get IRB approval before you can do that.</p><h4 id="project-proposals">Project Proposals
<a href="#project-proposals"></a></h4><p>In class, each student (or student teams) will present a <strong>project pitch</strong>. This is a 5 minute presentation motivating the problem they would like to explore, and a sketch of what work they would do to explore it. The goal is to get feedback on ideas from the rest of the class, and to nail down the work to be done. Students/teams can pitch up to two projects, if they want advice to choose between them.</p><p>A couple of weeks after the pitch, teams will turn in a <strong>project proposal</strong>, which formalizes what they will do. It should recap the motivation from the pitch, and include the timeline and deliverables for the project. It should also mention risks toward completing the project. Total length should be around 3 pages.</p><h4 id="deliverables">Deliverables
<a href="#deliverables"></a></h4><p>The <strong>project report</strong> will be graded by content – how insightful, useful, and complete is the work covered – as well as adherence to format and content guidelines from the class, including, for example, whether the introduction answers key questions about the motivation for the project, whether the results section provides and interprets a key result, whether the related work section distinguishes current effort from prior work, and so on.</p><p>The <strong>project presentation</strong>, like the report, will be scored based on format and content matching guidelines given in class (one of the things you’ll be learning is what it means to give a good talk, write a good report, and so on). Presentations should be about 20 minutes long, with 5 minutes for questions.</p><p>The project report will be due 11:59:59pm EST of the day given in the project description for full credit. Project reports (and code, if relevant) may be submitted up to 24 hours late for a 10% penalty. (For example, a project that would have earned 90 points for an on-time submission will earn 81, that is, 90 times 0.90.) If you submit both on-time &amp; late, your project will received the maximum of the penalty-adjusted scores.</p><h3 id="meet-the-professor">Meet the professor
