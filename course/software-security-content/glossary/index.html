All valid behaviors of the program are represented by the abstraction, but invalid ones may be too.</p><p><strong>Abuse case</strong>(4) - A scenario that details a potential security failure if some defense is not put in place. Used during the design phase to motivate and justify security-related design decisions.</p><p><strong>Access control</strong>(4) - A kind of security policy that governs what principals have access to resources, and what kind of access (e.g., read vs. write) is allowed. There are different kinds of access control policies, e.g., role-based policies vs. discretionary policies.</p><p><strong>Address space</strong>(1) - The range of possible (physical or virtual) addresses available to a process or system.</p><p><strong>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</strong>(2) - This is a technique by which the starting address of memory areas is chosen randomly when a process is executed. Such randomization makes it harder to perform attacks which might otherwise rely on addresses not changing.</p><p><strong>Alias</strong>(5) - An alias is another name for the same thing. In programming, this comes up with pointers: a program may have two pointers to the same object, where one pointer is an alias for the other.</p><p><strong>Architecture</strong>(1) - Short for “computer architecture.” Refers to the hardware computing platform that runs programs, which notably consists of a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals.</p><p><strong>Audit</strong>(4) - The process of determining whether a security breach has occurred, and how. A system must be built to be auditable, e.g., by logging security-relevant data. Can also refer to the process of studying a system for vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Authentication</strong>(4) - The process by which the purported identity of an actor is confirmed. Examples include password checking and biometric scanning.</p><p><strong>Authorization</strong>(4) - The process by which a principal’s proposed action is determined to be acceptable, or not, according to a system’s security policy.</p><p><strong>Availability</strong>(0,4) - Refers to a classic security requirement about a system’s operation; a system is<em>available</em>if it can be accessed by authorized principals when sought. A violation of availability is often called a<em>denial of service</em>.</p><h2 id="b">B

Branches can be conditional — they occur only if a condition is met — or unconditional (sometimes referred to as “jumps”).</p><p><strong>Buffer overflow</strong>(1) - A vulnerability in a program in which an attacker can cause a pointer to access outside of the intended bounds of the buffer it points to. Sometimes this term more narrowly refers to the act of writing beyond the bounds of a buffer, but in this course we use it more generally to include reads as well.</p><p><strong>Bug</strong>(0) - A bug is a coding mistake in a program that causes it to behave incorrectly and/or insecurely.</p><h2 id="c">C

Typically, a compiler takes a program in a high-level language, like C or FORTRAN, and compiles it to a program into the language of a particular processor, which can then run that program.</p><p><strong>Completeness</strong>(5) - A<em>complete</em>analysis is one that, if some property<em>X</em>is true, then analysis says<em>X</em>is true. As applied to static analysis, we interpret completeness to mean: if the analysis says that there is a bug, then there really is one; i.e., there are no false positives.</p><p><strong>Concolic execution</strong>(5) - A kind of symbolic execution in which we run the program concretely, but keep track of symbolic values and the path condition “on the side”. When the program terminates, this information can be used to generate a test that will take the program down a different path.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>(0,4) - Refers to a classic security requirement about a system’s data; data enjoys confidentiality if it cannot be learned by an unauthorized principal. Also referred to as<em>secrecy</em>and<em>privacy</em>(where the latter is used when referring to an individual)</p><p><strong>Constraint graph</strong>(5) - An abstraction of a program that expresses directional constraints on its behavior. For example, when considering flow analysis, constraints indicate whether data can flow form one variable/position to another, and all constraints together can be visualized as a graph.</p><p><strong>Context sensitivity</strong>(5) - A feature that adds precision to a static analysis whereby a call to a function from one part of the program can be distinguished (i.e., analyzed separately from) another call.</p><p><strong>Control flow graph (CFG)</strong>(2) - a graphical representation of the program, where nodes in the graph are basic blocks, and edges indicate the possibility of control transferring from the source block to the target block.</p><p><strong>Control flow integrity (CFI)</strong>(2) - This is a property of a program execution. An execution satisfies control flow integrity if it conforms to a model of the program’s control flow, determined in advance. Typically this model is a control-flow graph. CFI is often enforced as an in-line reference monitor.</p><p><strong>Cookie</strong>(3) - a piece of data associated with a particular web host and stored by the client’s browser. Sent along with subsequent requests to that host. Used to implement sessions and personalization, and privacy-threatening tracking.</p><p><strong>Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>(3) - An attack by which a browser is induced by one site to submit a request to another site to perform an illicit action.</p><p><strong>Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</strong>(3) - An attack whose goal is to get a browser to execute a Javascript program originating at one site to execute with the privileges (according to the same-origin policy) of another site.</p><h2 id="d">D

Sometimes also called a stale pointer. A<em>dangling pointer dereference</em>is a bug that occurs when the program tries to access the memory pointed to by a dangling pointer.</p><p><strong>Data execution prevention (DEP)</strong>(2) - DEP is a service provided by the hardware and/or operating system that enforces memory can either be writeable or executable, not both. With DEP enabled, attacker-provided buffers cannot be executed directly, and thus cannot (usefully) contain code. DEP does not prevent return-to-libc or ROP attacks, which use code already in the program.</p><p><strong>Defect</strong>(0) - A defect is a problem in a software system. The problem could be either in the design of the system, in which case we call it a<em>flaw</em>, or in the implementation, in which case we call it a<em>bug</em></p><p><strong>Dereference</strong>(1) - To dereference a pointer means to either read or write the memory that the pointer points to</p><p><strong>Direct call</strong>(2) - A call or jump to a target where the target is a constant. For example, the call printf(“hello\n”) directly calls the printf function.</p><p><strong>Dynamic analysis</strong>(5,6) - An analysis of a program’s execution, often designed to find bugs. Oftentimes this analysis happens concurrently with the execution, and may terminate that execution if it observes illegal behavior.</p><h2 id="e">E

Environment variables are passed to programs that are spawned from the shell, along with the command-line arguments.</p><p><strong>Escaping</strong>(3) - The process of transforming a string, altering characters that might be interpreted as control characters in the current context to be inert. For example, a user string containing a &lt; would be escaped in an HTML context to instead be &lt;</p><p><strong>Exploit</strong>(1) - An exploit is a series of steps by which an adversary interacts with a system to turn a vulnerability, or vulnerabilities, in the system into an attack whose outcome is to his advantage.</p><h2 id="f">F

When a function goes to return, it checks that the stack canary is still intact; if not, an attack may have overflowed over it.</p><p><strong>Stack frame</strong>(1) - A group of data on the stack that is associated with a particular function call. In the x86 standard calling convention, the stack frame stores the arguments passed to the function, the function’s local variables, and other metadata about the call, such as the frame pointer and return address.</p><p><strong>Stack pointer</strong>(1) - This is the address of the logical top of the stack.

Ideally, the trusted computing base is small and simple, so that trust placed in it is warranted.</p><p><strong>Turing completeness</strong>(2) - A Turing complete system or language is one that can simulate a single-taped Turing machine. Such a machine is known to be very computationally expressive, so the Turing completeness of a system shows that it is similarly very expressive.</p><p><strong>Type inference</strong>(5) - A kind of static analysis whose goal is to assign a type to a program fragment (like a variable or function). Types may be standard language types (like int or float) or enhanced types expressing other program properties (like tainted int or untainted float).</p><p><strong>Type safety</strong>(2) - Type safety is a consistency property of a programming language: it states that programs accepted by the language’s type system are also well-defined.
