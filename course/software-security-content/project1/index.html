<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VirtualBox</a> format. The overall VirtualBox manual is available
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The first step is to install VirtualBox on your computer; our VM images have been tested with version 4.3.18. There are specific instructions for installing VirtualBox for computers running
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#installation_windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows</a>,
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#install-linux-host" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux</a>, and
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html#idp52693904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac OSX</a>.</p><p>The next step is to download the virtual machine image, in OVF format, that we will use for the project. It has extension .ova meaning it is an archive with all of the relevant materials in it. The file can be found
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPNIkEzF_mdhAmxGSDSp3BZ57D7gxVqp/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The file is 1.3 GB in size. The virtual machine runs a version of
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu Linux</a>. The SHA1 of the file is 6fb69359d595d81599713c4d02dc8e947d3d6cef.</p><p>Finally, you must import this OVF file, which is called mooc-vm3.ova, and run it. To import it, it should be as simple as double-clicking the .ova file. Doing so will start VirtualBox and ask you whether to import it the image. You should then click “import”. Alternatively, rather than double clicking the archive file, you can select “File” -&gt; “Import appliance” from the Manager window and select the file. Further instructions are available
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#ovf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Note that if using an earlier version of Virtual Box (4.2.x and earlier), the VM may not import; some have had success importing by disabling the DVD and USB flags.</p><p>Having imported the VM, you should see it in your list of VMs. Select it and click “Start”. This will open a window running the virtual machine, starting up Ubuntu Linux. When you get to a login screen, use username “seed” and password is “dees” (but without quotes). Then start up a terminal window – there is an icon in the menu bar at the top for doing so (it looks like a computer monitor).</p><h2 id="the-vulnerable-program">The vulnerable program

You can run the program by typing ./wisdom-alt on the command prompt. When we do this, we see the following greeting:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>seed@seed-desktop:~/projects/1$ ./wisdom-alt
Hello there
1. Receive wisdom
2. Add wisdom
Selection &gt;
</code></pre><p>At this point, it is waiting for the user to type something in. Typing the number 1 allows you to “receive wisdom” and typing 2 allows you to “add wisdom”. Extending the interaction, suppose we type 1 (and a carriage return).</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>seed@seed-desktop:~/projects/1$ ./wisdom-alt

Enter some wisdom
</code></pre><p>Now the program is waiting for the user to type something in. Suppose we type in sleep is important and press return. Then we will get the standard greeting again. If we type 1 at that point we will get the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Selection &gt;2

To input binary data to the program, use the following command line instead:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>./runbin.sh
</code></pre><p>Then we can type in binary-format strings (e.g., with hex escaping). For example:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>seed@seed-desktop:~/projects/1$ ./runbin.sh

2. Add wisdom
Selection &gt;2
Enter some wisdom
\x41\x41
Hello there
1. Receive wisdom
2. Add wisdom
Selection &gt;1
AA
</code></pre><p>In the above, \x41\x41 represents two bytes, defined in hexadecial format. 41 in hex is 65 in decimal, which in ASCII is the character A. As a result, when we ask for wisdom, the program prints AA. Entering something like \x07 would be a byte 7. This is not a printable character, but is the “bell”. So when it “prints,” you would actually hear a sound (if sound were enabled on this VM).</p><p>To exploit the program, you will have to enter sequences of binary bytes that contain addresses, which are 4-byte (i.e., 32-bit) words on the VM. The x86 architecture is “little-endian”, meaning that the bytes in a word are stored from least significant to most significant. That means that the hexadecimal address 0xabcdef00 would be entered as individual bytes in reverse order, i.e., \x00\xef\xcd\xab. Here is a
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/Data/endian.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresher on endianness</a>, if you need it.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: runbin.sh is a shell script that is just a wrapper around the following code:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>while read -r line; do echo -e $line; done | ./wisdom-alt
</code></pre><p>This is what is converting the hex digits into binary before passing them to the wisdom-alt program. When carrying out the lab, please use the runbin.sh program, and not the above code directly, or your answers may be slightly off, as discussed at the end.</p><h3 id="using-gdb">Using GDB

You can find out this information using the gdb program debugger. You can attach gdb to your running program, and then use it to print information about the state of that program, and step through executions of that program.</p><p>To attach gdb to wisdom-alt, you should first invoke ./runbin.sh, and then, in a separate terminal, from the projects/1 directory invoke the following line:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>gdb -p `pgrep wisdom-alt`
</code></pre><p>The -p option to gdb tells it to attach to a running program with the process ID (PID) given to the option. The command pgrep wisdom-alt searches the process table to find the PID of the wisdom-alt program; this PID is then fed as the argument to -p. Be warned: If you have multiple wisdom-alt programs running, you may not attach to the one you expect! Make sure they are all killed (perhaps by killing and restarting the terminals you started them in) if you run into trouble. Also, be sure you use backquotes around pgrep wisdom-alt and not forward quotes.</p><p>Once you have connected to the process, you can start using gdb commands to start examining its state and controlling it. For example:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>seed@seed-desktop:~/projects/1$ gdb -p `pgrep wisdom-alt`

Breakpoint 1 at 0x80487ea: file wisdom-alt.c, line 100.
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
</code></pre><p>Here we enter a command to set a breakpoint at line 100 of wisdom-alt.c. Then we enter command cont (which is short for continue) to tell the program to resume its execution. In the other terminal, running wisdom-alt we enter 2 and press return. This causes execution to reach line 100, so the breakpoint fires, and the gdb command prompt comes up again, pausing the program in the process.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Breakpoint 1, main () at wisdom-alt.c:100
100            int s = atoi(buf);

(gdb) print s
$1 = 2
(gdb) print &amp;r
$2 = (int *) 0xbffff530
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
</code></pre><p>Then, we control the program by stepping using “next”, which executes the current line of code, proceeding to the next. Then we print the contents of variable s with “print”, and it displays the value we entered in the other terminal. Then we continue execution by entering “cont”. In the other terminal we see the prompt to enter some wisdom.</p><p>When you are done working with gdb (perhaps when you’ve terminated the other program), just type quit to exit.</p><p>The basic GDB commands you will want to use are those we have already demonstrated: setting break points, stepping through execution, and printing values.

When you complete this section’s questions, you can enter your answers in the
<a href="/courses/software-security/assets/week1_BOF_quiz.docx">on-line assessment</a>.</p><p>The first step is to identify where the vulnerabilities are. To do that you will have to look through the code of wisdom-alt.c. You can do this by using an editor on Linux virtual machine, like vi or emacs, both of which are installed. Alternatively you can look through the file on your own machine outside of the VM, in an editor of your choice — the file is available
<a href="/courses/software-security/projects/1/wisdom-alt.c">here</a>.</p><p>After looking over the code to see how it works, answer the following four questions.</p><ol><li>There is a stack-based overflow in the program. What is the name of the stack-allocated variable that contains the overflowed buffer?</li><li>Consider the buffer you just identified: Running what line of code will overflow the buffer? (We want the line number, not the code itself.)</li><li>There is another vulnerability, not dependent at all on the first, involving a non-stack-allocated buffer that can be indexed outside its bounds (which, broadly construed, is a kind of buffer overflow). What variable contains this buffer?</li><li>Consider the buffer you just identified: Running what line of code overflows the buffer? (We want the number here, not the code itself.)</li></ol><p>Now use GDB to examine the running the program and answer the following questions. These questions are basically going to walk you through constructing an exploit of the non-stack-based overflow vulnerability you just identified. We will do less “hand holding” when asking about exploiting the stack-allocated buffer.</p><p>Once you have answers for all of the questions here, you can enter them on the Coursera site for full credit.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: When carrying out the lab, you must follow the instructions given above <strong>exactly</strong> for running the program (using runbin.sh) and using GDB (attaching to wisdom-alt in a separate terminal, and not running gdb ./wisdom-alt) or else the answers you get may not match the ones we are expecting. In particular, the addresses of stack variables may be different. These addresses might also be different if you have altered any environment variables in the Ubuntu terminals. To confirm that things are as they should be, recall the GDB interaction above, where we print the address &amp;r with the result being 0xbffff530 – if you are not getting that result when you reproduce that interaction then something is wrong. You should restart fresh terminals and begin from scratch, following the instructions exactly.</p><p>On to the first exploit:</p><ul><li>What is the address of buf (the local variable in the main function)? Enter the answer in either hexadecimal format (a 0x followed by 8 “digits” 0-9 or a-f, like 0xbfff0014) or decimal format. Note here that we want the address of buf, not its contents.</li><li>What is the address of ptrs (the global variable) ? As with the previous question, use hex or decimal format.</li><li>What is the address of write_secret (the function) ? Use hex or decimal.</li><li>What is the address of p (the local variable in the main function) ? Use hex, or decimal format.</li><li>What input do you provide to the program so that ptrs[s] reads (and then tries to execute) the contents of local variable p instead of a function pointer stored in the buffer pointed to by ptrs? You can determine the answer by performing a little arithmetic on the addresses you have already gathered above – be careful that you take into account the size of a pointer when doing pointer arithmetic. If successful, you will end up executing the pat_on_back function. Enter your answer as an unsigned integer.</li><li>What do you enter so that ptrs[s] reads (and then tries to execute) starting from the 65th byte in buf, i.e., the location at buf[64]? Enter your answer as an unsigned integer.</li><li>What do you replace \xEE\xEE\xEE\xEE with in the following input to the program (which due to the overflow will be filling in the 65th-68th bytes of buf) so that the ptrs[s] operation executes the write_secret function, thus dumping the secret? (Hint: Be sure to take endianness into account.)
771675175\x00AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xEE\xEE\xEE\xEE</li></ul><p>Now let’s consider the other vulnerability:</p><ul><li>Suppose you wanted to overflow the wis variable to perform a stack smashing attack. You could do this by entering 2 to call put_wisdom, and then enter enough bytes to overwrite the return address of that function, replacing it with the address of write_secret. How many bytes do you need to enter prior to the address of write_secret?</li></ul><p>To work out the answer here, you might find it useful to use the GDB backtrace command, which prints out the current stack, and the x command, which prints a “hex dump” of the bytes at a given address. For example, by typing x/48xw $esp you would print out 48 words (the w) in hexadecimal format (the x) starting at the address stored in register $esp.</p><p>Now that you have answered all the questions, enter them in the
