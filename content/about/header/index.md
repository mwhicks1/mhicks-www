I am the Cecilia Fitler Moore [Professor in the Computer and Information Science Department](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/computer-and-information-science/) and the Director of the [Schlein Center for Cybersecurity](https://giving.upenn.edu/data-with-due-diligence/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/computer-and-information-science/), and I am an [Amazon Scholar](https://www.amazon.science/scholars).

Previously, I was a Senior Principal Scientist at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) where I co-led (with [Emina Torlak](https://emina.github.io/)) development on the [**Cedar authorization policy language**](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/), which is part of [Amazon Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/).

I am also a Professor Emeritus (retired 2022) in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) and [UMIACS](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/). With [Jeff Foster](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/) I founded [**PLUM**, the lab for *Programming Languages research at the University of Maryland*](https://plum-umd.github.io/); [David Van Horn](http://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Edvanhorn/) and [Leo Lampropoulos](https://lemonidas.github.io/) are its current directors. I am currently the Editor in Chief of [Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmpl).

Here is my current [vita](cv.pdf) and a list of my [publications](papers/mwh.html), organized [by year](papers/mwh.html) and [by category](papers/mwh-cat.html).

## Research

My research focuses on improving software availability, reliability, and security through programming languages and software engineering techniques. Current areas include:

- **Secure programming**: Developing [Checked C](https://github.com/secure-sw-dev/checkedc), a memory-safe extension to C for legacy code migration; conducting [Build it, Break it, Fix it](https://builditbreakit.org) contests to evaluate secure development practices; and working with safe languages like Rust
- **Fuzz testing**: Developing methodologies for evaluating randomized testers and combining coverage-guided fuzzing with property-based testing
- **Quantum computation**: Creating verified compiler stacks for quantum programs, including [VOQC](https://github.com/inQWIRE/pyvoqc), and developing robust quantum programs for near-term devices
- **Privacy & cryptography**: Building languages for secure multiparty computation ([Wysteria](https://bitbucket.org/aseemr/wysteria/wiki/Home), [Symphony](https://mhicks.me/papers/darais21symphony.html)); developing authenticated data structures and compiler-optimized oblivious RAM

Past projects include dynamic software updating (Kitsune, Rubah), information flow control (LWeb, Prob), incremental computation (Adapton), type systems for Ruby (Diamondback Ruby), symbolic execution (Otter), race detection (LockSmith), and the memory-safe C dialect [Cyclone](http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/).
